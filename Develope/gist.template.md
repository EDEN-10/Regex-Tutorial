## Components

Now Let's Look At the essential components 

## Anchors

This application is modifed to to make a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Quantifiers

 *The starter code is a template with a title, introductory paragraph, summary, and table of contents.



## Character Classes

The example REGEX inlcudes the following quantifiers: + which is used to match one or more of the preceding token {2,6} which matches the specified quantity of the previous token, in this case between 2 and 6 characters. Alternatives would be {2,6}, which looks for 2 digits exactly, or {2,4} which looks for 2 or more characters.

## Flags

Flags employed to compile a list of permitted characters. There are two different character classes in the sample syntax. The quantifier is what causes each class to return a varied number of characters even if they appear to be exactly the same because they are.

##  Grouping and Capturing

Grouping and Capturing inlcudes the following group: ([a-z0-9_.-]+), this expression includes + which means we match at least one or more of any characters in the square brackets [a-z0-9_.-]. a-z is lowercase letters from a to z, 0-9 is numbers from 0 to 9, _ is underscore, . is period, and - is hyphen.

##  Bracket Expressions

Based on the example below the bracket expression will match a character having a character code between the two specified characters inclusive. [a-z] The [] (bracket) matches any character in the set.
-a, b, c, d, e, or f are all case-sensitive single characters that fall inside the range a to f.

## Greedy and Lazy Match

For matching emails, greedy and lazy matches are not included.

## Boundaries

The metacharacter \b is an anchor like the caret and the dollar sign. It matches at a position that is called a “word boundary”. This match is zero-length.

## Back-references



## Look-ahead and Look-behind

    Look-ahead and Look-behind are zero-length assertions just like the start and end of line, and start and end of word anchors explained earlier in this tutorial. The difference is that lookaround actually matches characters, but then gives up the match, returning only the result: match or no match. That is why they are called “assertions”. They do not consume characters in the string, but only assert whether a match is possible or not. Lookaround allows you to create regular expressions that are impossible to create without them, or that would get very longwinded without them.
